# most ignored files are just for testing/notes, and are not actually projects...
# or they are incomplete to the point where they don't yet serve their purpose...
# language folders are ignored if there are less than like 3 programs in it.
# or they are temporary, not original (ie jQuery.js), a joke (ie 3quine.html), etc
# executables and object files are ignored because I didn't write them
# pdfs are included because they are viewable and useful
