Section 1 - Definitions:

    The following definitions will stay unchanged for the duration of the file.

    Section 1a: "software" refers to any of the associated files or documentation.
    Section 1b: "user" refers to any person obtaining a copy of the software.
    Section 1c: "owner" refers to the author(s) or owner(s) of the copyright for the software.
    Section 1d:
        "sell" means "to give, give up, or surrender in some way, in exchange for a price or
        reward, which may or may not be monetary in nature".
    Section 1e:
        "substantial" means "Considerable in importance, value, degree, amount, or extent.",
        where "considerable" means "Worthy of consideration or large in amount, extent, or degree;
        significant."
        A single mathematical document is substantial, see Section 1f.
    Section 1f:
        "Mathematical Documents" refers to any files that are mostly or entirely based on or about
        mathematical information, formulas, theorems, ideas, et cetera. These can be PDFs LaTeX
        code files, Images (PNG, SVG, or otherwise), or any other file format.
        Also, Engineering, Physics, etc things also are included here, just in case.


Section 2 - General Statement:

    Permission is hereby granted, with caveats, by the "owner" (see section 1c), free of charge, to
    any person (the "user", see section 1b) obtaining a copy of this software AND (meaning both)
    associated documentation files (the "software", see Section 1a), to deal in the software the
    rights to use, modify, merge, publish, and/or sublicense copies of the software.


Section 3 - Monetary Use:

    The user may not sell, publish or sublicense, modified or not, the software or any substiantial
    (see Section 1e) portion of the software UNLESS it has been merged into or added to a different
    and considerable project that serves a different purpose than just being a copied version of
    the software. This purpose can't just be a fake reason just so the user can sell the software.

    If the user's intentions are or resemble being to steal from, infringe upon the rights of, copy
    directly, or rip off the owners or others, the user may not sell, publish or sublicense the
    software or any parts of it regardless of substantiality, but can otherwise still use it.


Section 4 - Mathematical Documents:

    The user may not sell, publish, sublicense, or merge any mathematical documents without written
    and express consent from the owner. When the user refers to any mathematical documents from
    other works, they must give credit to the owner.

    Any mathematical documents that are copied must be done so IN THEIR ENTIRETY so any names,
    dates, or copyright information on them is still clearly visible. There will always be a name
    on the mathematical documents.


Section 5 - Extra Conditions:

    ALL users are subject to the following conditions in addition everything previously mentioned:

    This entire license shall be included in its entirety in all copies or substantial portions of
    the software.

    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING

    DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
