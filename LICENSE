Section 1 - Definitions:

    The following definitions will stay unchanged for the duration of the file.

    Section 1a: "software" refers to any of the associated files or documentation.
    Section 1b: "user" refers to any person obtaining a copy of the software.
    Section 1c: "owner" refers to the author(s) or owner(s) of the copyright for the software.
    Section 1d:
        "sell" means "to give, give up, or surrender in some way, in exchange for a price or
        reward, which may or may not be monetary in nature".


Section 2 - General Statement:

    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person (the "user", see section 1b)
    obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "software", see
    Section 1a), to deal in the software the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and/or
    sublicense copies of the software.


Section 3 - Monetary use:

    The user may not sell, modified or not, the software or any substiantial portion of the
    software unless it has been merged into or added to a different project that serves a different
    purpose than just being a copied version of this software. This purpose can't just be a fake
    reason just so the user can sell the software. For instance, if the software is merged into a
    project where the only other file just prints "Hello World", that is a fake purpose and doesn't
    count. If the user's intentions are or resemble being to steal from, infringe upon, copy
    directly, or rip off the owners or others, the user may not sell the software or any parts of
    it.


Section 4 - Conditions:

    any users are subject to the following conditions in addition to things previously mentioned:

    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in its entirety in all
    copies or substantial portions of the software, ie: give credit where credit is due.

    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
    DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
