\title{On the Continuum Hypothesis and the Correspondence of Infinite Sets with the Natural Numbers}
\author{Daniel E. Janusch\\Dedicated to Maeby, my favorite kitty}
\maketitle

\begin{section}{Background and Countability Theorems}\label{sec:background}
	Any ``countable" set is equinumerous to a loose subset of the natural numbers,
	and there exists a bijection between them. Any finite set has this property, the
	main question being if all \emph{infinite} sets do. $|S|$ denotes the cardinality
	of a set $S$. In all infinite processes, one should think of the steps as executing
	simultaneously rather than separately and successively.\vspace{-1em}\\
	\begin{align}
		R\times S :=\{(r,s):r\in R\land s\in S\}~~(1 & \text a)
		\hspace{2.5em}
		R\cdot S :=\{r\cdot s:r\in R\land s\in S\}~~~(1\text b)
		\\
		R(\vec v\,):=\left\{\sum_{n=1}^{\dim\vec v}a_n\vec v_n:a_n\in R\right\}~~~(2 & \text a)
		\hspace{2.5em}
		R[\vec v\,]:=\left\{\prod_{n=1}^{\dim\vec v}(a_n+\vec v_n):a_n\in R\right\}~~~(2\text b)
	\end{align}

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:finite unions}
		\emph{Single Unions of Countable Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If any sets $R$ and $S$ are countable, $R(a)\cup S(b)$ is countable
		for all $a$ and $b$.}
	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		Equations (2a) and (2b) describe what I will call ``ring operators." $R$ and $S$
		being countable implies $R(a)$ and $S(b)$ are as well because ring operators keep
		cardinalities the same. Interlace the elements of $R(a)$ with those of $S(b)$,
		skipping over any duplicates. If either set is finite, append its elements to the
		beginning of the other set sans duplicates. Similar logic works using $R[a]$
		or $S[b]$.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:multiplications}
		\emph{Multiplications and Cartesian Products of Countable Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If any sets $R$ and $S$ are countable, both $R\times S$ and
		$R\cdot S$ are countable.}
	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		To create $R\times S$, put all possible ordered pairs into a table as shown.
		One can go along the diagonals, including every element in the output, and
		not ``missing" any, implying a bijection between $R\times S$ and $\mathbb N$.
		The numbers and colons in the table are the output indices, the first 25 labeled if in
		view. Similar logic works for $R\cdot S$. This method is also algorithmically
		viable (see Section~\ref{sec:algorithm code}). The output indices relate
		strongly to triangle numbers.\vspace{0.5em}\\

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:subsets}
		\emph{Subsets, Intersections, and Differences of Countable Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If any set $R$ is countable, any loose subset $S$ of $R$ is also countable.}

	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		For each element in $R$ but not in $S$ ($x\in R\smallsetminus S$), move its index to the beginning
		of $R$ and then remove it. That way, the set is still guaranteed to be countable. Since every set
		along the way is countable, so is $S$. This also implies that set intersections and differences
		are countable because these operations return subsets of the original sets.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:rings}
		\emph{Sum and Product ``Rings" From Countable Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If any set $R$ is countable, $R(a, b)$ and $R[a, b]$ are also countable
		for all $a$ and $b$.}
	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		Create 2 new intermediate sets $S_a := \{a\cdot r:r\in R\}$ and $S_b := \{b\cdot r:r\in R\}$.
		$S_a\times S_b$ gives a set with the same countability as $R(a,b)$, only with
		ordered pairs instead of addition. This is countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications}.
		Similar logic works for $R[a,b]$. They're not actually rings, it's just similar syntax for
		similar things.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:powers}
		\emph{Finite Natural Powers of Countable Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If any set $R$ is countable, $R^n$ is also countable for all natural
		numbers ($\mathbb N_0$) $n$.}
	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		$R^n$ can be factored as $R\times R^{n-1}$ which is countable if $R^{n-1}$ is countable. This can be applied recursively until it becomes countable if $R^2$ or $R\times R$ is
		countable, which is countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications}. If $n=0$, the
		output set is all the groups of zero elements from $R$, or just $\O$, which is countable
		since $\left|\O\right|$ is finite. This theorem is unused in this document.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:infinite unions}
		\emph{Countably Infinite Unions of Countably Infinite Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If all sets $R_i$ are countable, $\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^{\aleph_0} R_i$ is also
		countable, where $\aleph_0\equiv\left|\mathbb N\right|=\infty$.}
	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		Give each set $R_i$ a column in a table and put all its elements in that column going down.
		Do this for every set and using the same argument as in Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications},
		one can show that every element is indexed and none are skipped. Every column represents
		a different $R_i$ and the rows represent a different $\left(R_i\right)_j$ or $R_{i,j}$.
		The numbers before the colons are the output index. The first 85 are shown if in view.
		This is algorithmically viable, even though this table has a slightly different
		numbering than that of Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications}.

\pagebreak\begin{section}{Applications of the Theorems}\label{sec:applications}
	\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Integers}\label{subsec:applications.integers}
		Claim: $\mathbb Z$ is a countable set.
		\begin{proof}
			Let $R=\mathbb N_0$, $S=\mathbb N_1$. $R$ and $S$ are countable axiomatically
			(axiom of extensionality), being the naturals themselves. $\mathbb Z\equiv R
			\cup S(-1)$. This is countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:finite unions}.
		\end{proof}
	\end{subsection}

	\vspace{-1em}\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Rationals}\label{subsec:applications.rationals}
		Claim: $\mathbb Q$ is a countable set.
		\begin{proof}
			The rationals are basically just ordered pairs of integers and naturals.
			$R:=\mathbb Z$, $S:=\mathbb N_1$. $R\times S$ defines all of these pairs.
			$R$ is countable via Section~\ref{subsec:applications.integers} and $S$ is
			countable axiomatically. $R\times S$ is thus countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications}.
			This argument and Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications} derives from Cantor's argument for the rationals.
		\end{proof}
	\end{subsection}

	\vspace{-1em}\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Reals from Zero to One}\label{subsec:applications.reals 0 to 1}
		Claim: $\left\{x\in\mathbb R:0\leqslant x<1\right\}$ is a countable set.
		\begin{proof}
			Let $R$ be some set. Each $R_i$ can be defined to be the digits of $i$ reversed
			with ``0." at the beginning and infinite optional trailing zeros at the end, for
			any $i\in\mathbb N_0$. For example, $R_{246}=0.642\overline0$ and
			$R_0=0.0\overline0=0$. This set is countable because it was defined to be countable;
			each natural number corresponds to a single element. This set contains every real
			number in the range because every possible sequence of digits is in it. The sequence
			trends upwards, asymptotically approaching 1, though it fluctuates wildly along the way.
		\end{proof}
	\end{subsection}

	\vspace{-1em}\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Non-Negative Reals}\label{subsec:applications.non negative reals}
		Claim: $\mathbb R_{\geqslant0}$ or equivalently $\left\{x\in\mathbb R:
		x\geqslant0\right\}$ is a countable set.
		\begin{proof}
			The set of real numbers from zero to one is countable via
			Section~\ref{subsec:applications.reals 0 to 1}. Let $R$ be the same set
			used in that proof.
			$\mathbb R_{\geqslant0}=\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^{\aleph_0}S_i$ where
			$S_i:=R[i-1]$. This is countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:infinite unions}.
			The following table illustrates this.
		\end{proof}
		\centerline{\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} % 7 columns
			\hline 0.\overline0 & 1.\overline0 & 2.\overline0 & 3.\overline0 & 4.\overline0 & 5.\overline0 & \cdots\\

		\end{array}}
	\end{subsection}

	\pagebreak\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Reals}\label{subsec:applications.reals}
		Claim: $\mathbb R$ is a countable set which implies
		$\left|\mathcal P(\mathbb N)\right|\equiv\left|\mathbb N\right|$.
		\begin{proof}
			$\mathbb R_{\geqslant0}$ is countable via Section~\ref{subsec:applications.non negative reals}.
			$\mathbb R_{\geqslant0}(1, -1)\equiv\mathbb R$. This is countable via
			Theorem~\ref{thm:rings}. This conclusion can be further reinforced by
			the algorithmic methods later on. For each real number $x$, there exists
			at least 1 sequence of elements in $R$, each element with a higher index
			than the last, where the limit of the sequence equals $x$. This is because
			every sequence of digits is contained by $R$.
		\end{proof}
	\end{subsection}

	\begin{subsection}{Countabilities of Miscellaneous Number Classes}
	\label{subsec:applications.miscellaneous}
		\begin{subsubsection}{Algebraic and Transcendental Numbers}
			\label{subsubsec:applications.misc.reals}
			Claim: $\mathbb A$ and $\mathbb T$ are countable sets.
			\begin{proof}
				$\mathbb R$ is a countable set via Section~\ref{subsec:applications.reals}.
				Since the algebraic reals and transcendental reals are both subsets of the
				reals, they are countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:subsets}. They are also
				countable over the complex numbers using Section~\ref{subsec:applications.complex}
				and the same logic.
			\end{proof}
		\end{subsubsection}

		\begin{subsubsection}{Imaginary Numbers}\label{subsubsec:applications.misc.imaginary}
			Claim: $\mathbb I$ is a countable set.
			\begin{proof}
				$\mathbb R$ is a countable set via Section~\ref{subsec:applications.reals}.
				$\mathbb R(\sqrt{-1})\equiv\mathbb I$. This is countable via
				Theorem~\ref{thm:finite unions}, or more precisely $R(\sqrt{-1})\cup\O$
				is countable. The union of any set and the null set is itself.
			\end{proof}
		\end{subsubsection}
	\end{subsection}

	\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Complex Numbers}\label{subsec:applications.complex}
		Claim: $\mathbb C$ is a countable set.
		\begin{proof}
			$\mathbb R$ is a countable set via Section~\ref{subsec:applications.reals}.
			$\mathbb R(1, \sqrt{-1})\equiv\mathbb C$. This is countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:rings}.
			The identity used here stems from the rectangular form of complex numbers.
		\end{proof}
	\end{subsection}

\begin{section}{Addressing Cantor's Diagonal Argument}\label{sec:diagonal argument}
	According to Georg Cantor in 1891, If someone is trying to list all the real numbers,
	they can always find a number that is not in the list using his ``Diagonal Argument".
	This argument is basically the same as the following, though for reals instead of
	naturals: Suppose someone is trying to make a set $S$ with every natural number. They first
	add zero to the set and the set is $\{0\}$, then they could say, ``one isn't in the set."
	When they add one and have $\{0,1\}$, they can say ``two isn't in the set," then ``three
	isn't in the set," ``four isn't in the set," et cetera. No matter how many natural numbers
	they add, they can always find one not in it; $\max(S)+1$. Using Cantor's same logic, this
	seems to be implying that there is not a bijection between the natural numbers and
	themselves, which is clearly wrong. Every set is bijective onto itself via the identity
	function. $f(x) := x$ for  $f:X\mapsto X$.
\end{section}

\pagebreak\begin{section}{Enumerating the Continuum Algorithmically}\label{sec:algorithm code}
	The following Node JS code prints out real numbers to stdout delimited by a comma-space
	pair. With infinite time and memory, it will have printed every real number. The only
	problems are that it prints out both $0$ and $-0$, and the functions return strings.
	Both of these are easily resolvable though. There is a reference to this source code and
	the C version in Section~\ref{sec:references}. The subscripts are just so it looks nicer.
	If \texttt{process.stdout.write} is replaced with \texttt{console.log}, then it will work
	in vanilla JavaScript in versions beginning with ECMAScript 6. The downside being
	\texttt{console.log} adds a trailing newline character at the end of each call, which
	isn't ideal for printing a large quantity of small strings each using an individual
	function call. The complexity of finding the $n$th real number with this method is less
	than or equal to $\mathcal O\!\left(n\log^2n\right)$, emphasis on ``less", because
	after over 16 million iterations on my machine, it hadn't slowed down noticably.

\end{section}

\pagebreak\begin{section}{Further Algorithms and Conclusion}\label{sec:further algorithms}
	The axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set theory required to prove the algorithmic viability
	of continuum enumeration are as follows: Axiom Schema of Specification, Axiom of Union,
	Axiom of Infinity, and Axiom of Choice (for groups of 2 elements). Without the Axiom of Choice,
	Theorems~\ref{thm:multiplications},~\ref{thm:rings},~and~\ref{thm:infinite unions}
	don't work, although the algorithm from Section~\ref{sec:algorithm code} is separate
	from set theory and assumes no axioms. The algorithm uses string manipulation to reverse
	the numbers and find their lengths, but the following equations do the same thing
	mathematically.
	\begin{align}
		\text{length}\,n & := 1+\left\lfloor\log_{10}n\right\rfloor=\left\lceil\log_{10}(n+1)\right\rceil\\
		\text{reverse}\,n & :=\sum_{k=0}^{\text{length}\,n}\left(\left\lfloor\frac n{10^k}\right\rfloor\text{mod}\,10\right)\!10^{\text{length}\,n-k-1}\\
		R_{i,j} & :=p\left(i+\frac{\text{reverse}\,j}{10^{\text{length}\,j}}\right)
	\end{align}
	Where $i$ is \texttt{k}, $p$ is \texttt{(positive~?~1~:~-1)}, and $j$ is \texttt{(u - k)}.
	length() and reverse() are only defined for natural number inputs. An interesting formula
	used in the algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm code} is for the greatest triangle
	number $t=T(k)$ less than or equal to a natural number $n$, with a natural number index $k$.
	\begin{align}
		T(n) & := \frac{n^2+n}2=\sum_{j=1}^nj\\
		t & = T\left(\left\lfloor\frac{\left\lfloor\sqrt{8n+1}\right\rfloor}2\right\rfloor-1\right)
	\end{align}
	Because of the bijection, there is also an inverse of the Section~\ref{sec:algorithm code}
	algorithm.\\\\
	\noindent\texttt{function inverse(string) \{ // assume valid input\\
		$\indent$const match = /\textasciicircum(-?)($\backslash$d+)$\backslash$.($\backslash$d\+)\$/.exec(string)\\
		$\indent\indent$, i = BigInt(match[2]) // the x coordinate index, or the integer part\\
		$\indent\indent$, j = BigInt(match[3]); // the y coordinate index, or the decimal part\\
		$\indent$return i*(i+1n) + (2n*i+j)*(j+1n) + BigInt(match[1] === "-");\\
		\}
	}\\
	Conclusion: Since there exists a bijection between the natural numbers and the real numbers,
	there is no set with a cardinality strictly or loosely in between the naturals and reals
	(CH), because they are the same. This also implies that $2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_0$. This makes sense because $2^\infty=\infty$ as well. Also if one takes any sequence of natural numbers
	and concatenates them, it will always create a new natural number, meaning every element in
	$\mathcal P(\mathbb N_0)$ corresponds to a natural number. This could have disasterous
	consequences for set theory because CH is provably undecidable in some models and yet
	provably decidable. This means either ZHC is unsound, or at least one of the proofs
	is invalid. The entire foundation of aleph numbers and sizes of infinities could be
	deeply flawed to the core.
