\title{On the Continuum Hypothesis and the Correspondence of Infinite Sets with the Natural Numbers}
\author{Daniel E. Janusch\\Dedicated to Maeby, my favorite kitty}
\maketitle

\begin{section}{Background and Countability Theorems}\label{sec:background}
	If a set is ``countable," there exists a bijection between it and loose subset of the
	natural numbers (equinumeral). Any finite set will have this property and the only
	question is if all \emph{infinite} sets have it. $|S|$ denotes the cardinality of $S$
	for any set $S$. Iterated set multiplication of the first kind gives ordered groups
	with more than two elements, rather than nested ordered pairs. In all processes
	with infinite steps, all the steps should execute simultaneously.\vspace{-1em}\\
	\begin{align}
		R\times S :=\{(r,s):r\in R\land s\in S\}~~(1 & \text a)
		\hspace{2.5em}
		R\cdot S :=\{r\cdot s:r\in R\land s\in S\}~~~(1\text b)
		\\
		R(\vec v\,):=\left\{\sum_{n=1}^{\dim\vec v}a_n\vec v_n:a_n\in R\right\}~~~(2 & \text a)
		\hspace{2.5em}
		R[\vec v\,]:=\left\{\prod_{n=1}^{\dim\vec v}(a_n+\vec v_n):a_n\in R\right\}~~~(2\text b)
	\end{align}

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:finite unions}
		\emph{Unions of Countable Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If any pair of sets $R$ and $S$ are countable, $R(a)\cup S(b)$ is countable for all $a$ and $b$.}
	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		Since $R$ and $S$ are countable, $R(a)$ and $S(b)$ are as well because this just
		multiplies the already present elements by a constant. Interlace the elements of
		$R(a)$ with the elements of $S(b)$ skipping over any duplicates. If either of the
		sets runs out, meaning it is finite, stop interlacing and only pull elements from
		the infinite set. Similar logic works using $R[a]$ and $S[b]$ or combinations of
		those, $R(a)$, and $S(b)$.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:multiplications}
		\emph{Multiplications of Countable Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If any pair of sets $R$ and $S$ are countable, $R\times S$ and $R\cdot S$ are countable.}
	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		Put ordered pairs using elements all the of $R$ and $S$ into a table as shown below
		and go along the diagonals getting every element in the product and not ``missing"
		any. The numbers and colons are the indices. The first 25 are labeled if in view.
		Similar logic works for $R\cdot S$. This is also algorithmically viable as shown
		in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm code}.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:subsets}
		\emph{Subsets, Intersections, and Differences of Countable Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If any set $R$ is countable, and a set $S$ is a loose subset of $R$, $S$ is also countable.}
	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		For each element in $R$ but not in $S$ ($x\in R\setminus S$), move its index to the beginning
		of $R$ and then remove it. That way, the set is still guaranteed to be countable. Since every set
		along the way is countable, so is $S$. This also implies that set intersections and differences
		are countable because these operations return subsets of the original sets.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:rings}
		\emph{Sum and Product ``Rings" From Countable Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If any set $R$ is countable, $R(a, b)$ and $R[a, b]$ are also countable
		for all $a$ and $b$.}
	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		Create 2 new intermediate sets $S_a := \{a\cdot r:r\in R\}$ and $S_b := \{b\cdot r:r\in R\}$.
		$S_a\times S_b$ gives a set with the same countability as $R(a,b)$, only with
		ordered pairs instead of addition. This is countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications}.
		Similar logic works for $R[a,b]$. They're not actually rings, it's just similar syntax for
		similar things.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:powers}
		\emph{Powers of Countable Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If any set $R$ is countable, $R^n$ is also countable for all natural numbers $n$
		\,($\mathbb N_0$).}
	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		$R^n$ can be factored as $R\times R^{n-1}$ which is countable if $R^{n-1}$ is countable.
		$R^{n-1}$ can be factored as $R\times R^{n-2}$ which is countable if $R^{n-2}$ is countable,
		et cetera. This can be simplified continuously until it becomes countable if $R^2$ or
		$R\times R$ is countable, which is countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications}. If $n=0$,
		the output set is all the groups of zero elements from $R$, or just $\O$, which is countable
		since $\left|\O\right|$ is finite. This theorem is unused in this document.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:infinite unions}
		\emph{Countably Infinite Unions of Countable Sets}\\
		\indent\emph{If all sets $R_i$ are countable, $\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^{\aleph_0} R_i$ is also
		countable, where $\aleph_0\equiv\left|\mathbb N\right|=\infty$.}
	\end{thm}\begin{proof}
		Give each set $R_i$ a column in a table and put all its elements in that column going down.
		Do this for every set and using the same argument as in Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications},
		one can show that every element is indexed and none are skipped. Every column represents
		a different $R_i$ and the rows represent a different $\left(R_i\right)_j$ or $R_{i,j}$.
		The numbers before the colons are the output index. The first 85 are shown if in view.
		This is algorithmically viable, even though this table has a slightly different
		numbering than that of Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications}.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Integers}\label{subsec:applications.integers}
		Claim: $\mathbb Z$ is a countable set.
		\begin{proof}
			Let $R=\mathbb N_0$, $S=\mathbb N_1$. $R$ and $S$ are countable axiomatically,
			being the naturals themselves. $\mathbb Z\equiv R\cup S(-1)$. This is countable
			via Theorem~\ref{thm:finite unions}.
		\end{proof}
	\end{subsection}

	\vspace{-1em}\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Rationals}\label{subsec:applications.rationals}
		Claim: $\mathbb Q$ is a countable set.
		\begin{proof}
			The rationals are basically just ordered pairs of integers and naturals.
			$R:=\mathbb Z$, $S:=\mathbb N_1$. $R\times S$ defines all of these pairs.
			$R$ is countable via Section~\ref{subsec:applications.integers} and $S$ is
			countable axiomatically. $R\times S$ is thus countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications}.
			This argument and Theorem~\ref{thm:multiplications} derives from Cantor's argument for the rationals.
		\end{proof}
	\end{subsection}

	\vspace{-1em}\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Reals from Zero to One}\label{subsec:applications.reals 0 to 1}
		Claim: $\left\{x\in\mathbb R:0\le x<1\right\}$ is a countable set.
		\begin{proof}
			Let $R$ be some set. Each $R_i$ can be defined to be the digits of $i$ reversed
			with ``0." at the beginning and infinite optional trailing zeros at the end, for
			any $i\in\mathbb N_0$. For example, $R_{246}=0.642\overline0$ and
			$R_0=0.0\overline0=0$. This set is countable because it was defined to be countable;
			each natural number corresponds to a single element. This set contains every real
			number in the range because every possible sequence of digits is in it. The sequence
			trends upwards, asymptotically approaching 1, though it fluctuates wildly along the way.
		\end{proof}
	\end{subsection}

	\vspace{-1em}\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Non-Negative Reals}\label{subsec:applications.non negative reals}
		Claim: $\mathbb R_{\ge0}$ or equivalently $\left\{x:x\in\mathbb R\land x\ge0\right\}$ is a countable set.
		\begin{proof}
			The set of real numbers from zero to one is countable via
			Section~\ref{subsec:applications.reals 0 to 1}. Let $R$ be the same set used in that proof.
			$\mathbb R^+=\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=1}^{\aleph_0}S_i$ where $S_i:=R[i-1]$. This
			is countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:infinite unions}. The following table illustrates this.
		\end{proof}
		\centerline{\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} % 7 columns
			\hline 0.\overline0 & 1.\overline0 & 2.\overline0 & 3.\overline0 & 4.\overline0 & 5.\overline0 & \cdots\\

	\pagebreak\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Reals}\label{subsec:applications.reals}
		Claim: $\mathbb R$ is a countable set which implies
		$\left|\mathcal P(\mathbb N)\right|\equiv\left|\mathbb N\right|$.
		\begin{proof}
			$\mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ is countable via Section~\ref{subsec:applications.non negative reals}.
			$\mathbb R_{\ge0}(1, -1)\equiv\mathbb R$. This is countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:rings}.
			This conclusion can be further reinforced by the algorithmic methods later on. For each
			real number $x$, there exists at least 1 sequence of elements in $R$, each element with a
			higher index than the last, where the limit of the sequence equals $x$. This is because
			every sequence of digits is contained by $R$.
		\end{proof}
	\end{subsection}

	\begin{subsection}{Miscellaneous Number Classes}\label{subsec:applications.miscellaneous}
		\begin{subsubsection}{Algebraic and Transcendental Real Numbers}
			\label{subsubsec:applications.misc.reals}
			Claim: $\mathbb A$ and $\mathbb T$ are countable sets.
			\begin{proof}
				$\mathbb R$ is a countable set via Section~\ref{subsec:applications.reals}.
				Since the algebraic reals and transcendental reals are both subsets of the
				reals, they are countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:subsets}. They are also
				countable over the complex numbers using Section~\ref{subsec:applications.complex}
				and the same logic.
			\end{proof}
		\end{subsubsection}

		\begin{subsubsection}{Imaginary Numbers}\label{subsubsec:applications.misc.imaginary}
			Claim: $\mathbb I$ is a countable set.
			\begin{proof}
				$\mathbb R$ is a countable set via Section~\ref{subsec:applications.reals}.
				$\mathbb R(\sqrt{-1})\equiv\mathbb I$. This is countable via
				Theorem~\ref{thm:finite unions}, or more precisely $R(\sqrt{-1})\cup\O$
				is countable. The union of any set and the null set is itself.
			\end{proof}
		\end{subsubsection}
	\end{subsection}

	\begin{subsection}{Countability of the Complex Numbers}\label{subsec:applications.complex}
		Claim: $\mathbb C$ is a countable set.
		\begin{proof}
			$\mathbb R$ is a countable set via Section~\ref{subsec:applications.reals}.
			$\mathbb R(1, \sqrt{-1})\equiv\mathbb C$. This is countable via Theorem~\ref{thm:rings}.
			The identity used here stems from the rectangular form of complex numbers.
		\end{proof}

\begin{section}{Addressing Cantor's Diagonal Argument}\label{sec:diagonal argument}
	According to Georg Cantor in 1891, If someone is trying to list all the real numbers,
	they can always find a number that is not in the list using his ``Diagonal Argument".
	This argument is basically the same as the following, though for reals instead of
	naturals: Suppose someone is trying to make a set $S$ of every natural number. They first
	add zero to the set and the set is $\{0\}$, then they could say, ``one isn't in the set."
	When they add one and have $\{0,1\}$, they can say ``two isn't in the set," ``then three
	isn't in the set," ``four isn't in the set," et cetera. No matter how many natural numbers
	they add, they can always find one not in it; $\max(S)+1$. Using Cantor's same logic, this
	seems to be saying that there is not a bijection between the natural numbers and themselves,
	which is clearly wrong. Every set is bijective onto itself via the identity function.
	$f(x) := x$. $f:X\mapsto X$.
\end{section}

\pagebreak\begin{section}{Enumerating the Real Numbers Algorithmically}\label{sec:algorithm code}
	The following Node JS code prints out real numbers to the console delimited by a comma followed
	by a space. With infinite time and memory, it will have printed every real number. The only
	problems are that it prints out both $0$ and $-0$, and the functions return strings. Both of
	these are easily resolvable though. There is a reference to this source code and the C version
	in Section~\ref{sec:references}. The subscripts are just so it looks nicer. If
	\texttt{process.stdout.write} is replaced with \texttt{console.log}, then it will work in vanilla
	JavaScript in versions beginning with ECMAScript 6, although \texttt{console.log} adds a trailing
	newline character at the end of each call, which isn't ideal for printing a large quantity of small
	strings each using an individual function call. The complexity of finding the $n$th real number
	with this method is less than or equal to $\mathcal O\!\left(n\log^2n\right)$, but it is probably
	less, since after over 16 million iterations on my machine, it hadn't slowed down noticably.

	$\indent$);\\
	\}
	}
\end{section}

\pagebreak\begin{section}{Further Algorithms and Conclusion}\label{sec:further algorithms}
	The axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set theory required to prove the countability of the continuum are
	as follows: Axiom Schema of Specification, Axiom of Union, Axiom of Replacement, Axiom of Infinity,
	and Axiom of Choice. Without the Axiom of Choice, theorems 2, 4, and 6 don't work, which are all used,
	although the algorithm is separate from set theory and uses no axioms. The algorithm from
	Section~\ref{sec:algorithm code} uses string manipulation to reverse the numbers and find their lengths.
	The following equations can do the same thing without it.
	\begin{align}
		\text{length}\,n & := 1+\left\lfloor\log_{10}n\right\rfloor=\left\lceil\log_{10}(n+1)\right\rceil\\
		\text{reverse}\,n & :=\sum_{k=0}^{\text{length}\,n}\left(\left\lfloor\frac n{10^k}\right\rfloor\text{mod}\,10\right)\!10^{\text{length}\,n-k-1}\\
		R_{i,j} & :=p\left(i+\frac{\text{reverse}\,j}{10^{\text{length}\,j}}\right)
	\end{align}
	Where $i$ is \texttt{k}, $p$ is \texttt{(positive~?~1~:~-1)}, and $j$ is \texttt{(u - k)}. length
	and reverse are only defined for positive integer inputs. An interesting formula used in the
	algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm code} is for the greatest triangle number $t=T(k)$ less
	than or equal to a natural number $n$ with a natural number index $k$.
	\begin{align}
		T(n) & := \frac{n^2+n}2=\sum_{j=1}^nj\\
		\text{sgn}\,x & := \begin{cases}
			1,x>0\\
			0,x=0\\
			-1,x<0
		\end{cases}\\
		f(n) & := \frac{\left\lfloor\sqrt{8n+1}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\sqrt{8n+1}\right\rfloor\text{mod}\,2}2-1\\
		t & = T\circ f(n)
	\end{align}
	Because of the bijection, there is also an inverse of Section~\ref{sec:algorithm code}'s algorithm.\\\\
	\noindent\texttt{function inverse(string) \{ // assume valid input\\
		$\indent$const match = /\textasciicircum(-?)($\backslash$d+)$\backslash$.($\backslash$d\+)\$/.exec(string)\\
		$\indent\indent$, i = BigInt(match[2]) // the x coordinate index, or the integer part\\
		$\indent\indent$, j = BigInt(match[3]); // the y coordinate index, or the decimal part\\
		$\indent$return i*(i+1n) + (2n*i+j)*(j+1n) + BigInt(match[1] === "-");\\
		\}
	}\\
	Conclusion: Since there exists a bijection between the natural numbers and the Real numbers,
	there is no set with a cardinality strictly or loosely in between the naturals and reals (CH),
	because they are secretly the same. This also implies that $2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_0$ because
	$\left|\mathbb R\right|\equiv\left|\mathcal P\left(\mathbb N_0\right)\right|$. This makes sense
	because $2^\infty=\infty$ as well. There may not be different sizes of infinities after all. Also
	if one takes any sequence of natural numbers and concatenates them, it will always create a new
	natural number, meaning every element in $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)$ corresponds to a natural
	number. It makes sense why CH is independent of ZHC and can't be disproved within it, because
	it is true either way.
