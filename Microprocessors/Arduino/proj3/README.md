joystick:
 - the joystick controls both inversions and rotations of the image, which take place after  the other operations.
 - the joystick is only updated when the switch on pin 5 is on. otherwise it is frozen at the last read value.
 - pressing in the joystick causes the program to recalibrate for stick drift. This would only be important if the stick wasn't in a neutral position when the MCU booted.
 - if x > 0, then the image is inverted on the x axis
 - if y > 0, then the image is inverted on the y axis
 - from the start of each quadrant, there is are four ranges for the rotations.
	- 00.000° to 15.085°: no rotation
	- 15.086° to 45.000°: 90° ccw rotation
	- 45.001° to 74.914°: 180° rotation
	- 74.915° to 89.999°: 90° cw rotation
