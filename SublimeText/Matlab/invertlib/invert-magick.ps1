.synopsis
	Inverts the colors of image for some formats that ImageMagick supports.
.description
	Some of the formats I haven't tried, or I don't know what extension(s)
	they use, and others like MP4 and MKV technically work but they will
	introduce tearing or will output a blank white image, so I don't allow
	them. If you really want it anyway, or the functionality changes, you
	can call to magick yourself.

	use the `--help` argument to get valid and known invalid formats.

	The formats are determined to be valid or invalid based on version:
	ImageMagick 7.1.1-38 Q16-HDRI x64 b0ab922:20240901
		Compiled with Visual Studio 2022 (194134120)

formats that ImageMagick supports for reading and writing,
limited to ones that it is actually good for.

to add more formats later, use `magick identify -list format`

the object maps format to file extension.
