Please note that None of these files are valid `8xp` files; however, they still are valid TI-BASIC code made for the TI-84 plus.
The `8xp` file extention is used so GitHub will recognize it as a TI program.
All the programs should approximately work on the TI 84 plus CE, but the display is larger (10x26 instead of 8x16, rows x cols), so the coordinates of `Output(` calls may have to be adjusted if they are intended to be right or center-justified.
They will not work on the TI-Nspire, since that uses an incompatable version of TI-BASIC.
