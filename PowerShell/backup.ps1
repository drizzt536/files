#requires -version 7

<#
.synopsis
	backs up a drive to another drive, starting at some root directory.
	also works for updating an existing drive backup.
	removes stale backups for files that no longer exist on the source drive.

	basically a RAID 1 type thing.

	Doesn't work with mounted paths, but just don't have more than 26 drives at a time.

	Only works on Windows, but doesn't rely on anything other than PowerShell 7 and fsutil.exe.

	returns an exit code of 0 on success and 1 on fail. read the messages for the exit reason.

	color information:
		- gray/default: config data, generic updates, miscellaneous unimportant information
		- white: generic process updates (major steps).
		- yellow: notes, deviations from normal behavior, etc.
		- green: file move and delete messages.
		- orange: warnings, non fatal errors
		- red: fatal errors
		- blue: dry-run debug information (command strings)
.parameter inputDrive
	Alias: -srcDrive, -i

	The drive letter of the source drive. (the drive that is being backed up)
.parameter outputDrive
	Alias: -dstDrive, -o

	The drive letter of the destination drive. (the drive the backups will be put into)
.parameter root
	The root of the folder within the drive that should be backed up.

	Everything outside of the folder will not be backed up.
	An empty string means it backs up the whole drive.

	For D:/a/b/c/ as the root folder, use -root "a/b/c".
.parameter reference
	The file to use as a reference for what files are newer or older than the latest backup.
	The reference file should be on the destination drive and doesn't need to exist on the source drive.
	The reference file should not be a directory.

	The backup file is assumed to be placed in "${outputDrive}:/$root/". This can be overridded by
	making it start with "${outputDrive}:/", but it still has to be within the output drive.

	If the reference does not exist:
	 - if `-firstTime` was passed, the reference file is created.
	 - if `-firstTime` was not passed, an error is thrown.
.parameter keepStale
	Also: -k

	If this option is passed, the step for deleting stale backups is skipped.
.parameter confirmDelete
	Alias: -yes, -y

	If this option is passed, it will not ask before deleting stale backup files it finds.
	It will just print them out and delete them.
.parameter firstTime
	Alias: -create, -f

	If this option is passed, it indicates it is creating a backup instead of updating one.
	This skips the size comparison check, and changes behavior slightly.
.parameter dryRun
	Alias: -whatIf

	don't actually move or delete anything, but print out what would normally happen.
	some parts print out the exact command, and some parts don't.
.parameter skipVerify
	Alias: -bypassVerification, -b

	skip the full verification, and only verify newly copied files.
.parameter skipCorruptionCheck
	skip the heuristic checks for possible drive corruption.
.parameter skipAll
	equivalent to `-skipVerify -skipCorruptionCheck`

	skips full verification and drive corruption heuristics.
.parameter transferOnly
	Also: -t

	equivalent to `-skipAll -keepStale
.parameter help
	an alias of --help and -?
.example
	PS C:\> ./backup.ps1 D E path/to/root README.md -y -c

	 - Back up drive D: to E: starting from D:/path/to/root/
	 - Things outside that root directory will not be backed up
	 - It will skip the delete confirmation because of `-y`
	 - it will assume the backup does not yet exist.
.example
	PS C:\> ./backup.ps1 -src F -dst D -ref

	 - Back up the entirety of drive F: to D:
	 - it will use D:/backup-reference as the reference file.
	 - It will assume it is updating an existing backup,
	   and will ask for confirmation before deleting files
	 - checks for drive corruption using heuristics
.example
	PS C:\> backup.ps1 C E -t -dry

	- back up the entirety of drive C: to E:
	- use E:/backup-reference as the reference file
	- assume the backup exists already.
	- skip drive corruption check
	- skip full drive verification
	- skip stale file check
	- don't actually move files (dry run)

	`-dry -t` basically just lists out the files that have changed.
